# Bhagat

Bhagat is a work-in-progress RAT (remote administration tool) written in Python. The framework for the code allows for new commands and modules to be easily added. Bhagat uses standard TCP socket connections included with the default Python libraries and can run in the background silently once converted to .exe. 

This project is for educational use only. Please do not use Bhagat for nefarious, malicious, or illegal purposes.
